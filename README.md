# SimonGame
Based on the classic game Simon, a series of tones and lights that requires a user to repeat the sequence.

A series of tones and lights are created and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once
the user fails, the game is over.

A simple text-based simulation will display the word red, blue, green, or yellow. Each word will display briefly before displaying the next word. The first level starts with
one colour. If the user succeeds then the next level displays two colours. If the user succeeds then the next level displays 3 colours. This will continue until the user fails
to produce the correct sequence.
